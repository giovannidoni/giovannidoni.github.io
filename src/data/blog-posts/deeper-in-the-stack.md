*How AI is shifting the origin of product ideas deeper into the stack*

We often frame idea generation as a matter of direction: **top-down or bottom-up**.  
In other words, ideas either come from within, through leadership or employees, or from outside, through users and customers.  

That framing focuses on *who* ideas come from. But there is another dimension that matters just as much, especially organisationally: *where in the stack* momentum originates.  
Maybe it is because I tend to look at the stack cross-sectionally from the backend, but I have often felt that delivery capability used to be capped by the frontend, like a football team with no strikers.  

That was true until recently. **AI seems to be moving the traction point deeper into the backend.**  
Behavioural prototypes now emerge from model experiments long before any UI exists. In many teams, backend iteration is starting to lead the creative process.  

I used to think you needed all the plumbing in place before focusing on the model. That assumption has flipped.  
Today, the model often defines the system architecture rather than adapting to it.  

A growing share of products are shaped by **AI-powered behaviours** that emerge from the model itself, not by logic explicitly written by engineers.  
In some cases, the model even defines the UI surface for each user, deciding what is shown, when, and how.  
What used to be a static layer is now dynamically generated from backend reasoning.  

You can see this in how the frontend has become less of a blocker for backend progress, at least until the final polish phase.  

The same shift is happening organisationally.  
Context, once embodied by senior team members, is starting to move into systems.  
As LLMs absorb documentation and histories of decisions, knowledge is becoming a programmatic layer.  

This raises a question that feels increasingly central:  
**How can context be represented so it feeds both machines and humans, making ownership a transferable asset instead of a bottleneck?**  

Both reflections point to the same thing.  
Context is moving.  
Technically and organisationally, it is drifting deeper into the stack — and with it, the source of momentum for how products evolve.
